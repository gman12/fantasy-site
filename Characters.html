    <h3>Major Characters</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Raymar Finariel</strong></dt>
        <dd>The son of Lord Oraphoro Finariel, and the nephew of Toralin Finariel,
            <br /> King of Valindor and the Highlands, Prince Raymar Finariel is a headstrong young
            <br /> man who is adept in the arts of both war and magic. Despite his skills, he is
            <br /> still inexperienced, and prone to rash and immature decisions.</dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong>Proteus</strong></dt>
        <dd>A giant of a man, his strength and combat prowess is matched only by his unflinching
            <br /> loyalty to his charge, Raymar Finariel, whome he has known since both were children. While he takes
            <br /> his job very seriously, he is generally a jovial man of many jokes. He inherited his fantastic
            <br /> combat skills from his father and uncle, who are famed warriors themselves, and is especially dangerous
            <br /> with his massive warhammer.</dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong>Blain Orycinth</strong></dt>
        <dd>The captain of the guard of House Favriel, and close friend of Lord Genneth
            <br /> Favriel. A centaur veteran of many wars and battles, he is a noble and proud warrior,
            <br /> always trying to care for the lives of those around him.</dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong>Dareth of Granmire</strong></dt>
        <dd>One of the last Panorians in Renvieln, Dareth Finariel is originally from the land
            <br /> to the south known as Darross, where he was a memeber of the Order of the Rainbow, a prestigious
            <br /> order of mystics who controlled the various elements. He then went on to serve Lady Aisha, before
            <br /> accompanying her to Renvieln after she married the Elven lord Quentin Fairwood, whom he served thereafter.
            <br /> Dareth is a powerful elemental warrior, with an expert control over the element of fire.</dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong>Lea Fairwood</strong></dt>
        <dd>The daughter of Lord Quentin Fairwood, and heir to the Elven realm of Silvervale, Lea Fairwood
            <br /> is equally perilous as she is beautiful. An immeasurably proficient archer, she is also equally talented
            <br /> with magic. After spending her childhood in Silvervale, she moved to Mithral Erith as a ward of King Toralin
            <br /> where she befriended Raymar Finariel.</dd>
        <br />
        <dt><strong>Egen More</strong></dt>
        <dd>The son of Rhogen More, lord of the vast underground kingdom of Boldlind, Egen More is a gruff, no-nonsense
            <br /> dwarf who relishes the chance to use his fearsome battle-axe. Despite his short stature, he is never one to back down
            <br /> from a fight, although his lack of control over his loud mouth can sometimes put him in difficult situations. He
            <br /> spent much of his young adulthood in Gleavenford, where he formed a fast friendship with Captain Blain Orycinth.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Wulf Hefnir</strong></dt>
        <dd>A man with a complicated past</dd>
