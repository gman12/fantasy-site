    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>My name is Gaurav Sirdeshpande. I am currently a college student studying Computer
        <br /> Science. I also consider myself a budding writer, and <em>Swords for the Ages</em> is my first
        <br /> attempt at writing a full-fledged novel. When I am not writing or programming, you can probably
        <br /> find me playing tennis, piano, eating delicious food (avocados have a special place in my heart),
        <br /> or spending time with my friends and family.</p>
